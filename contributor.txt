Please both of them are requested to see what they had to commit. Basically my project is on the implementation of queue with c++. My project will contain a class of queue which will 
contain different member functions and member variables.Also it will contain the functions of Insert,Display and Delete .I have made a class named as queue and inserted a funtion a of
insertion in the master branch from the local repo in my machine.

SO PLEASE REVIEW YOUR COMMITS:

Make a function of display in the queue in a separate branch named as "insert" and push it there.

2.Nishkarsh
Make a function of delete in the queue in a seprate branch named as "delete" and push it there.
